ESRI JSAPI with Webpack and React

It has the following setup:

Static
  js: for all the bundles, components, services, stores, etc
  css: for all css code u have using sass, images, fonts, etc.

gulpfile.js :  for some automatic tasks

dist:
  css for ur production build
  js: for ur production build

Package.json: has some modules that maybe are unnecesary but i think they are really good to have for developing some form-apps.





```
npm install
npm run start
```



Specially thanks to : @lobsteropteryx and @tomwayson for all the help.
